<!-- Once upon a time, in a vast jungle, there lived an ant named Arlo and an elephant named Ella. Arlo was small, quick, and full of energy, while Ella was large, strong, and kind-hearted. Despite their size differences, the two were the best of friends.

One sunny afternoon, a terrible storm rolled in. Dark clouds filled the sky, and soon the rain began to pour heavily. The jungle animals scrambled to find shelter. Arlo, being small, quickly scurried into a tiny hole at the base of a tree, where he was safe from the rain. But Ella, being so large, had trouble finding shelter. The tree wasnâ€™t big enough to fit her, and the rain was coming down in torrents. -->
